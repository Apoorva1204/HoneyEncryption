#Hacker Page:

This page is designed to simulate a hacker's environment.

Usage of the name of `Hactivists groups (Anonymous & MINDAX) / Online Services (AWS)` mean no harm to them in any way.

First Page displays the hashed passwords breached from the Password Database.

We assume that the hashed passwords are cracked using an Online  Resource-as-a-Service instead of going for offline cracking.

The Second page shows the set of plain text passwords, obtained after cracking at an Online service.
