###Features of PHP Login Script:

1. A simple, but secure PHP login script (using PDO.)
2. Blowfish hashing with dynamic salting
3. Session Variables used instead of cookies
4. Additional features like file extension removal
5. Session Time-out : 60 seconds (Can be changed as per requirement)
6. Wrong URL redirects client to a cute `404 Error Page`.

###HoneyWords Generation:

1. Previously breached password compiled database containing `43,56,248 Passwords` sorted in alphabetical order
2. Similar passwords are generated by `hw_generator.py` (Python 3.4 or higher required to be installed)
3. Honeywords generation modules:
	a. Chaffing Method
	b. Chaffing by Tweaking Module
	c. Other user passwords as Honeywords
	(Tough Nut Module is not included in this project)
	

###User Analytics:

1. Detects client's Operating System
2. Detects client's Browser
3. Records Client's IP Address
4. Records Client's Geolocation (Longitude & Latitude), Country, Country Code & City (via. api.host.info)**

#####Note: The 4th module has been commented in the code page as I had implemented over localhost

*`api.ipaddresslabs.com` provides detailed info. (Continent Code, Continent Name, Country Code, Country Name, Region Code, Region Name, City, Postal Code, Metro Code, Area Code, Longitude, Latitude, ISP, organisation) even on a 30-Days Demo License.*


###Features of Decoy Page:

1. Welcome page is similar to Genuine USer's page, but the links won't work (except logout).
2. Breacher's details (OS, Browser, IP) are recorded separately.
3. URL of decoy page is socially engineered (looks very similar to original ones).
